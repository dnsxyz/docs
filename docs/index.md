# Welcome to the Mailscript documentation

Mailscript brings the best features of bots and smart contracts for email.

Use our free API and CLI, in any language. No complicated setups.

## Technologies

Learn about the different technologies that make-up Mailscript:

- [CLI](#cli)
- [API](#api)
- [SDK Clients](#sdk-clients)
- [Templates](#templates)
- [Community](#community)

### CLI

Getting started as easy as `yarn add global mailscript`

### API

It is possible to integrate Mailscript's services directly into your own projects. To do so you can interact with the API directly. The API was built using the [OpenAPI Specification](https://swagger.io/resources/open-api/) which allows developers to interact with the underlying abstractions directly.

You can use the following API definitions file: [`http://api.mailscript.com/swagger`](http://api.mailscript.com/swagger) and we also offer a playground to try the API here: [`http://api.mailscript.com/docs/v1/`](http://api.mailscript.com/docs/v1).

Take into consideration that these two endpoints work with production code and are subject to account limits and every usage counts against those limits.

### SDK Clients

Coming soon. We will be offering sdk clients that implement object wrappers on top of the API. Developers will be able to import/require these libraries directly into their codebases to start using Mailscript.

### Templates

Read our templates on setting up your infrastructure and automations with Mailscript in GitHub.

#### Pipe email attachments to an endpoint

Setup the first step of a pipeline with data from email attachments: [attachments to webhook](https://github.com/mailscript/template-attachments-to-webhook).

#### Manage your email infrastructure

Version control your email infrastructure and setup a continuous integration process whenever you submit changes.

#### Auto-reply to first time senders

Let first time senders know you'll get back to them.

#### Escalate notifications

Send an sms text message when the important messages arrive: [two alert messages in a minute to send sms](https://github.com/mailscript/template-two-alerts-to-sms).

#### Send messages to your team channels

Notify your discord/slack channels when something needs their attention: [run failed to discord #channel](https://github.com/mailscript/template-run-failed-to-discord).

#### Setup shared addresses for your team

Setup a group of employees to receive messages directed to an address and have them all be able to reply from such address: [shared address for teams](https://github.com/mailscript/template-shared-address-for-team).
